1. add sound
2. check logic
3. refactor, make basic class and sub class

issues:
1. collsion detection is not good, 
in pygame, just detect if two rectangles overlap,
this method bad for collsion detection.
2. image rotate is not smooth
3. ship will move horizontally or vertically when slow down, 
seems to be problem of pygame about rect.move, need to verify.
